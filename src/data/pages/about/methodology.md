title: Methodology | Headstone Addresses

# Methodology

In compliance with FOIP, we used publicly released data of burial dates and death years from 1995 and earlier,
as found using the
[City of Edmonton Cemetery Search](https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/municipal_cemeteries/cemetery-search.aspx).

A shortlist of surnames was gathered by the Research Assistant from the Cemetery Search database for each of the
three selected cemeteries. It is noted that some surname and firstname discrepancies were found, as well as some
birth and death year data was inputted incorrectly. All spelling of names in this project reflects the
characters and words transcribed by hand by the Project Lead directly from on-site visits.

All Chinese words on the headstones were in Traditional Chinese characters, accurately reflecting the geography
and historical connections of these communities in Canada from the 1800s onwards. These characters were
transcribed as accurately as possible by hand, and translated by the Project Lead and Research Assistant in
context.

The Jyut Ping style of romanization into English characters was used for this project to best reflect the
specific and relevant heritage and history represented by the data. Related languages of the ethnocultural
groups represented by the data include but are not limited to: Cantonese, TeowChow, Hokkienese, and Toisanese.

Mount Pleasant and Edmonton Cemetery had plots scattered in various sections around the cemetery. Edmonton
Cemetery featured a row of neighbouring headstones all facing east. Beechmount Cemetery official map denotes
“Chinese Section” and features rows of headstones with Chinese words. In-person visits to cemeteries are
encouraged to best experience the different styles of headstones, locations, and connections in this project.

The geographical location names denoted for 16 cities and towns were collected from the Headstone Addresses and
used to establish clusters. Please note that place names and village, town, or city designations may have
changed. There may be unintentional transcription and translation mistakes due to erosion of the headstones and
calligraphy styles.

145 complete addresses were gathered from the
[3 Historical Cemeteries of Edmonton](https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/municipal-cemeteries), spanning
lifetimes from 1872 to 1995. The historical and geopolitical ties are framed within understanding Canada’s
colonial history, global migration patterns, as well as labour policies and settlement stories; specifically to
Treaty 6 lands around Edmonton.

- **Mount Pleasant Cemetery** Shortlisted 66 sites, visited 68 sites, and collected 15 complete addresses.
- **Edmonton Cemetery** Shortlisted 148 sites, visited 162 sites, and collected 81 complete addresses.
